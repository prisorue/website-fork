To perform the validation with LLM Inference you must comply with one of the prerequisites:
* Have an AI Factory ready to be validated; or,
* Configure an AI Factory by following one of these options:
     * [On-premises AI Factory Deployment]({{% relref "/solutions/deployment_blueprints/ai-ready_opennebula/cd_on-premises" %}})
     * [AI Factory Deployment on Scaleway Cloud]({{% relref "/solutions/deployment_blueprints/ai-ready_opennebula/cd_cloud"%}})

As industries adopt Large Language Models (LLMs), optimization and validation of their inference performance are critical aspects of the deployment. Efficient inference is essential to guarantee that LLMs deliver high-quality results while maintaining scalability, responsiveness, and cost-effectiveness.

The LLM Inference Benchmarks focus on measuring performance metrics during the model serving process rather than the quality of the generated result. Metrics assessed by this type of benchmarks include:
  - **Latency**: how fast the model responds to a request.
  - **Throughput**: the number of requests the model can handle per unit of time.
  - **Stability**: model serving consistency under varying loads.

In this guide you will find the necessary steps and best practices to perform LLM inference benchmarking with OpenNebula.

## The vLLM Inference Framework

The vLLM Inference Framework is a benchmark that focuses on [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/), a production-grade, high-performance inference engine designed for large-scale LLM serving.

The main characteristics of vLLM Inference Framework are:

- Supports single-node deployments with one or more GPUs.
- Uses Python’s native multiprocessing for multi-GPU inference.
- Does not require additional frameworks, such as Ray, unless deploying across multiple nodes, which is out of scope for this benchmarking task.

## Benchmark Environments

To test the vLLM appliance, the benchmark uses two similar environments, but with different GPU models:
- Benchmark environment 1: 1x NVIDIA L40S 48GB GPU cards
- Benchmark environment 2: 1x NVIDIA H100L 94GB GPU card

## Benchmarks

The certification includes two LLM architectures — Qwen and Llama — each tested in two different parameter sizes.

Qwen Models:
- `Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct`
- `Qwen/Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct`

Llama Models:
- `meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct`
- `meta-llama/Llama-3.2-7B-Instruct`

The benchmark process is based on [GuideLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/guidellm), the native benchmarking tool provided by vLLM for optimizing and testing deployed models.

### Executing the Benchmarks

#### Deploying the vLLM Appliance

The vLLM appliance is available through the OpenNebula Marketplace, offering a [streamlined setup process](https://github.com/OpenNebula/one-apps/wiki/vllm_quick) suitable for both novice and experienced users.

To deploy the vLLM appliance for benchmarking, follow these steps:

1. Download the vLLM appliance from the marketplace:
    ``` shell
    $ onemarketapp export 'service_Vllm' vllm --datastore default
    ```

2. Configure the template for [GPU PCI passthrough](../../../product/cluster_configuration/hosts_and_clusters/nvidia_gpu_passthrough.md):
    ```shell
    $ onetemplate update vllm
    ```

    In this scenario, configure the template for GPU Passthrough to the VM and the specific CPU-Pinning topology:
    ```shell
    CPU_MODEL=[
        MODEL="host-passthrough" ]
    OS=[
        FIRMWARE="/usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_CODE_4M.fd",
        MACHINE="pc-q35-noble" ]
    PCI=[
        CLASS="0302",
        DEVICE="26b9",
        VENDOR="10de" ]
    TOPOLOGY=[
        CORES="8",
        PIN_POLICY="THREAD",
        SOCKETS="2",
        THREADS="2" ]
    VCPU="32"
    CPU="32"
    MEMORY="32768"
    ```

3. Instantiate the template. Keep the default attributes, only changing the LLM Model through the `ONEAPP_VLLM_MODEL_ID` input for each benchmark you do, which means that you will need to instantiate a different VM with the different models for the execution of each benchmark:
    ```shell
    $ onetemplate instantiate service_Vllm --name vllm
    ```

4. Wait until the vLLM engine has loaded the model and the application is served. To confirm progress, access the VM via SSH and check the logs located in `/var/log/one-appliance/vllm.log`. You should see an output similar to this:
    ```shell
    [...]

    (APIServer pid=2480) INFO 11-26 11:00:33 [api_server.py:1971] Starting vLLM API server 0 on http://0.0.0.0:8000
    (APIServer pid=2480) INFO 11-26 11:00:33 [launcher.py:36] Available routes are:

    (APIServer pid=2480) INFO 11-26 11:00:33 [launcher.py:44] Route: /v1/models, Methods: GET

    [...]

    ```

    At this point, the vLLM API is available. Perform a test it through curl, pointing to the port 8000 of the VM and querying the `v1/models` path:
    ```shell
    $ curl http://localhost:8000/v1/models | jq .
    ```

    You will retrieve a json response with the loaded models:
    ```json
    {
        "object": "list",
        "data": [
            {
            "id": "Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct",
            "object": "model",
            "created": 1764154926,
            "owned_by": "vllm",
            "root": "Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct",
            "parent": null,
            "max_model_len": 1024,
            "permission": [
                {
                "id": "modelperm-431ea3199da545b2a5cba62dc373ab53",
                "object": "model_permission",
                "created": 1764154926,
                "allow_create_engine": false,
                "allow_sampling": true,
                "allow_logprobs": true,
                "allow_search_indices": false,
                "allow_view": true,
                "allow_fine_tuning": false,
                "organization": "*",
                "group": null,
                "is_blocking": false
                }
            ]
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

    Additionally, the appliance includes a webchat app for interacting with the vLLM chat API. This web application is exposed through the VM `5000` port:

    ![vLLM webchat](/images/solutions/deployment_blueprints/llm_inference_certification/vllm_web.svg)

    If these verification steps are successful, the vLLM appliance is ready to run the benchmarks.

####  Running the Benchmark Scripts

Within the `/root` directory of the vLLM appliance, you will find [`benchmark.sh`](https://github.com/OpenNebula/one-apps/blob/ec3f5b740dc2a4201f8ed971f93beb195202bfef/appliances/Vllm/scripts/benchmark.sh) which executes GuideLLM CLI. This script automatically detects environment parameters, launches the benchmark using GuideLLM, and displays live updates of progress as well as results through the CLI. Specifically, the benchmark follows these steps:

- To test performance and stability, the script sends hundreds of requests in parallel.
- To run the benchmark, the script uses automatically-generated synthetic data with these values:
    - Input prompt: average 511 tokens.
    - Output prompt: average 255 tokens.
    - Total samples: 999.
- GuideLLM identifies the throughput that the inference can handle.
- Once the throughput is identified, 9 additional runs are performed at a fixed requests-per-second rate (below the identified throughput) to determine stability and final results.

To run the benchmark, follow this procedure:

1. Connect to the vLLM appliance through ssh:
    ```shell
    $ onevm ssh vllm
    ```

2. Execute the benchmark script:
    ```shell
    root@vllm$ ./benchmark
    ```

    After the benchmark is running, you will see this output:
    ![vLLM benchmark](/images/solutions/deployment_blueprints/llm_inference_certification/benchmark.svg)

    There are more parameters available within the benchmarking such as warmups, number of steps, and seconds per step. These parameters are fixed but can be manually adapted if needed.

3. Once finished, the process outputs the results on the terminal and generates an HTML report with all given information in the `/root/benchmark_results` directory:

    ![vLLM benchmark results](/images/solutions/deployment_blueprints/llm_inference_certification/benchmark_results.svg)


### Benchmark results

The following key performance metrics have been be tested for each model:

| Metric                            | Description                                                                              | Unit   |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |--------|
| Request rate (throughput)         | Number of requests processed per second.                                                 | req/s  |
| Time to first token (TTFT)        | Time elapsed before the first token is generated.                                        | ms     |
| Inter-token latency (ITL or TPOT) | Average time between consecutive tokens during generation.                               | ms     |
| Latency                           | Time to process individual requests. Low latency is essential for interactive use cases. | ms     |
| Throughput                        | Number of requests handled per second. High throughput indicates good scalability.       | req/s  |

Different application types have distinct performance requirements. The following GuideLLM reference SLOs provide general benchmarks for evaluating inference quality (times for 99% of requests):
