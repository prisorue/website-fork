Organizations today are looking for flexible, open solutions to simplify their IT infrastructure, consolidate workloads, and build scalable private, hybrid, and edge clouds. By adopting a unified cloud management and virtualization platform, they can reduce operational complexity, lower costs (TCO), and gain complete control over their digital infrastructure.

OpenNebula is a mature, open platform that provides complete cloud and virtualization management—combining in a single and a lightweight solution all the capabilities of a hypervisor manager such as VMware vSphere, a cloud orchestrator such as Nutanix Cloud Platform, as well as a hybrid/edge enabler.

Unlike proprietary alternatives, OpenNebula offers:

* A predictable subscription model with full access to all features.  
* Unified virtualization and cloud management.  
* Native edge and hybrid cloud support, including automatic resource provisioning on public clouds such as AWS.  
* Integrated Kubernetes orchestration via the OpenNebula Cluster API Provider.  
* Enterprise-grade scalability and automation, with high availability, multi-tenancy, and federation across sites.

Thousands of organizations worldwide already rely on OpenNebula as an open alternative to VMware vSphere&reg;, Nutanix Cloud Platform&reg;, and Red Hat OpenStack/OpenShift&reg;. These organizations benefit from an agile, secure, and future-ready cloud infrastructure that gives them complete control over their technology stack.

To assist with the preparation and completion of the numerous Requests for Proposal (RFPs) we receive every week, we have created the following table to help guide comparisons between OpenNebula and other cloud solutions.
